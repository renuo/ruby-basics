# This is to demonstrate, how rubocop can help you to use ruby-functions

# Uncomment the following code:

# for counter in (-1..5)
  # if counter == 0
  #   puts 'The counter is zero'
  # end
  #
  # if counter < 0
  #   puts 'The counter is negative'
  # end
  #
  #
  # if counter > 0
  #   puts 'The counter is positive'
  # end
# end

# then run `bundle exec rubocop -a -c .rubocop.yml`
